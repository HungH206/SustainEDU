This is the Project done by the Martianary Team at UH's CodeRED Astra 2025.

This is SustainEDU, an educational app done by Shiv, Thuy, Hung, and Fida

What it does:

1/ Photo Converter:
 MathPix API to convert Pics COCR into PDF, DOC, PPTX.

2/Note Assistant:
 Select your own file to process your work and questions through Gemini
 Help answers any questions, guidance on research work, and summarization for notes
 Revised to speech to generate Audio using ElevenLabs API.

How we built it:
We built SustainEdu as a web-based learning and sustainability dashboard using Flask as the backend and a combination of Gemini API, ElevenLabs, and MathPix OCR for the intelligence layer. Our system integrates three main tools:

MathPix Converter - converts handwritten or textbook notes into clean, searchable Markdown and PDFs.
AI Note Assistant - powered by Gemini, it answers questions about your uploaded notes and turns those responses into natural voice using ElevenLabs
Challenges we ran into
Integrating multiple APIs (MathPix, Gemini, and ElevenLabs). We struggled with handling different data formats, real-time audio generation, and keeping the user interface simple under time pressure.

Accomplishments that we're proud of:
 We built a working prototype that converts handwritten notes to Markdown, lets users ask AI questions, and generates natural audio responses. We’re proud of creating an accessible, sustainable learning tool that unites OCR, AI, and voice in one app.

What we learned:
 We learned how to efficiently connect diverse APIs, manage time under pressure, and design user-friendly AI tools. Most importantly, we realized how technology can make learning more engaging, interactive, and eco-friendly.

What's next for SustainEdu:
 Next, we plan to expand SustainEdu into a complete AI learning suite. We’ll add speech-to-text so users can talk directly to the assistant, AI-generated quizzes and flashcards for personalized review, and cloud storage for syncing notes across devices.
